## How to change stuff in this project 
so 

there are 3 index files 


One of them is a index cmd 

which is run to set up stuff 

index php is just a controller from codeigniter 


normaly its there place you do stuff



### MVC 

- Model view controller

- Model = databasse 

- view is the thing you see based on the model and and contoler 

- COnrtoler is the way you route views to actual urls 


- like localhost/airfarefoss.com is actually the file in Cheapskytravel/application/views/index.php



so,

 `Home.php is the index in application/views.php`


yes 

other banners would be added in other *-airways.php 
eg : british-airways.php 
<!-- 
all the stuff you need is in application views 

views are dumb 

they just show stuff 
Controllers know stuff about views and model and basically the brain part of web apps 

model is the data itself  -->
