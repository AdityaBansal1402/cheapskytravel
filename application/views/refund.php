<p>We understand that travel plans can change unexpectedly, and at our travel company, we strive to provide clear and easy-to-understand policies for cancelling and refunding flight tickets. Please carefully review the following information, and if you have any questions, feel free to contact our customer service team.</p>
<h3>Cancellation Policy:</h3>
<p>To cancel your flight ticket, you can log into your account on our website or contact our customer service team. The refund amount you'll receive will depend on the type of ticket you purchased and the timing of your cancellation.</p>
<p>For non-refundable tickets, cancelling within a certain timeframe before the scheduled departure may qualify you for a partial refund. Refundable tickets may qualify for a full refund, but cancellation fees may apply.</p>
<p>Please note that certain tickets may not be eligible for cancellation or refund, and any airline fees charged are non-refundable. Any changes made to your ticket may also result in additional fees or charges.</p>
<h3>Refund Policy:</h3>
<p>If your flight is cancelled by the airline, you may be eligible for a refund. The refund amount will depend on the airline's policy, and our customer service team can assist you in the refund process.</p>
<p>Some airlines may offer vouchers or alternative travel arrangements instead of a refund, and our customer service team can help you with rebooking or using the voucher.</p>
<p>However, flight cancellations or delays due to uncontrollable circumstances like natural disasters or weather may not qualify for a refund or compensation.</p>
<p>Please note that our service fees associated with the original travel booking are non-refundable, and we rely on suppliers for processing refunds. The refund process may take 60-90 days, and suppliers may charge a penalty for refunds.</p>

<p>All refund fees are assessed per ticket per person and will only apply if authorized by the supplier or waived based on airline/supplier rules. If a refund is not processed by the supplier, we will refund our fees for refund processing, but not our service fees for the original travel booking.</p>
