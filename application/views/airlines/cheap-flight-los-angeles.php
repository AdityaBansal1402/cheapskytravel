The summer months though can be hot, but remains the best time to visit the city.</p>

           <p>Los Angeles remains warm throughout the year. You therefore need to choose the right time to travel and save big. If the perfect beach weather is what you want then look forward to traveling in the peak season from June to September. If you are a budget-conscious traveler then think of enjoying your holidays in the City of Angels in the off-season from December through March.</p>
