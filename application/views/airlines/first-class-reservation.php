            <p>There are various ways in which you can get upgraded to first class. Loyalty pays. Consider flying with the same airline regularly and get access to the airline’s frequent flyer program, which will help you in getting an upgrade. If you have purchased an economy ticket then get an upgrade by using reward points or frequent flyer miles. Many airlines also allow passengers to bid on an upgraded seat after they have purchased a ticket for travel in economy class, premium economy and business class.</p>
            <span class="h4">What amenities do U.S. airlines offer in first class?</span>
            <p>Most major airlines in the United States have their own versions of first class, with many amenities being similar such as complimentary food and drinks, priority check-in, priority boarding and more spacious seats. However, the specifics will vary between airlines. Apart from the basic first class perks, the offerings to the passengers with first class tickets provided by each airline are the following:</p>
            <p><strong>Delta Airlines:</strong> First Class offerings by Delta Airlines include premium seats with ample legroom, priority boarding and deplaning, access to complimentary premium entertainment with Delta Studio where available, premium menu offerings (on select flights), healthier snacks, Starbucks coffee, plus complimentary beer, wine and spirits, and Wi-Fi where available, and personalized service.
</p>
<p><strong>American Airlines:</strong> Passengers with American Airlines first class flight tickets will be enjoying perks like lie-flat seats with direct aisle access, welcome drink before takeoff, multi-course meals, bedding, amenity kits, power outlets and USB ports at every seat, spa showers, expedited check-in and security, and access to International First Class lounges and Admirals Club lounges. Domestic first class on most flights offers a larger leather recliner seat, complimentary drinks, snacks and dining.</p>
<p><strong>United Airlines:</strong> United First passengers are provided complimentary alcoholic beverages and meals, priority boarding, and security line access premier access to airport travel services, free in-flight entertainment, two complimentary checked baggage and amenity kits.</p>

            <span class="h4">How much do first class plane tickets cost?</span>
            <p>The first class plane ticket price will vary depending on the destination, time of ticket purchase and airline. The cost of first class tickets for domestic flights in the USA will be at least $1,300 on average. However, for international roundtrip flights from the USA, the average cost will be the following: Hawaii - $2,200, Europe - $3,500, South America - $3,500, Asia - $3,800, India - $5,000, Australia - $5,800, and Africa - $5,800.</p>
         <span class="h4">Is flying domestic first class worth it?</span>
            <p>There is confusion among many people regarding the domestic first class and what it actually entails. The first class on domestic routes is mostly offered on widebody aircrafts, usually on transcontinental flights or between major hub cities. 
</p>
            <p>The seats are quite spacious than a recliner seat with a few extra inches of legroom. The amenities offered are much less than those offered on international flights. However, flying in spacious seats of domestic first class is surely a more comfortable experience than travelling in economy class. </p>
            <p>It also sometimes comes with a complimentary upgrade, or offered at a reasonable price. Whenever flying domestic first class you need to be fully prepared with moderate expectations considering the fact that the flying experience will be indeed comfortable, but will be devoid of many of the luxury trappings offered on long-haul international flights due to shorter duration on most domestic routes.</p>
