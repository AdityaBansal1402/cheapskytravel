           <p>Miami International Airport (MIA) is the largest airport in the south Florida area (which includes West Palm Beach, Fort Lauderdale and Greater Miami) and right next to the downtown. However, some tourists skip MIA and prefer to fly to the less-hectic Fort Lauderdale International Airport (FLL). They rent a car and drive 25 miles to Miami. Apart from rental cars, you can also take the metro and bus to reach downtown from MIA.</p>
           <p>The Miami-Dade Transit system offers 800 Metro Buses that will cost you $2.25 per trip. You also have the electrically-powered Metromover option which is free, and loops around Downtown and Brickell neighborhoods. Other options included Metrorail, trolleys and tri-rail.</p>
